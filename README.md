# Loan_Process

This project defines the requirements for a MIT bank that wants to automate its loan origination process.

The Business requirements document (BRD) defines the overview of the project. It involves the process of how stakeholders perform their role in each step. The online portal will save the bank a lot of paperwork that is associated with the loan.

The Use Case diagram shows how stakeholders interact with each other in the loan process. I have added checkpoints in some places to check whether the customer meets a certain requirement in each step of the loan process to automate the flow. These checkpoints will help the bank in deciding on whether the customer is qualified to get a loan from the bank or not.

The solution design for the loan process will help the bank to efficiently process the loan applications for their customers and provide a decision on their application in a reasonable amount of time.
